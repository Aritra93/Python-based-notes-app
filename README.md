# Python-based-notes-app
It is a simple notes app developed using the Python GUI TKinter library. I created this GUI application as a hobby in addition to tinkering with the Python GUI library
Most Python GUI-based note applications have three simple tasks: adding notes, Loading all of them when the app starts, and deleting selected notes. In this implementation, I have added an edit functionality that helps the user modify any selected notes without hassle.

Feel free to use and modify this code to further optimize this implementation.
